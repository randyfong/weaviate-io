# Overview

Understanding the capabilities of Weaviate Cloud (WCD) queries and implementing them practically in your applications is not always obvious. This article aims to help you bridge that gap by providing detailed explanations of common and easily implemented query types, along with a live tool to demonstrate the results.

Included is a downloadable application for Mac users to run live examples directly on their laptop. 

Feel free to copy and paste these queries into your own projects for use as a template for your own queries.

1. [Query App](#query_app). A working MacOS app that runs queries.

1. [Query Examples](#query_examples). Query prompt examples.

# Query Helper Application

**Weaviate Cloud (WCD) Queries: A Practical Guide** 

**Query Helper Application** 

A MacOS application you can use to perform a live test of Weaviate Queries.

API Settings 

The first order of business is to create the API keys needed to run the application as needed.

API Key Settings Panel

Of the 3 API Keys, the **Weaviate API key is already defined** for you and cannot be changed for this demo app.

An explanation of each key, how it is used, and a link to how to define your own appears below.

- **Weaviate API Key:** Access key to the Weaviate Vector DB that holds the domain data
- **OpenAI API Key:** Access key to OpenAI that Weaviate uses to access OpenAI Large Language Models to query embeddings. Create a key at: <https://openai.com/>
- **Cohere API Key:** Access key to Cohere that Weaviate uses for text embedding, generative AI and reranking. Create a key at: <https://cohere.com>/

Keys can be defined to the application by clicking on the settings icon to bring up the **API Key Settings Panel**.

Query Prompt Features include:

- **Copy Prompt:** For use in your own apps.    ![Copy Icon](./img/wcs_summary_05_iconCopy.png)
- **Reset Prompt to the Original One Selected:** Reset, if prompt was changed  ![Reset Icon](./img/wcs_summary_06_iconReset.png)manually.   
- **Search Prompt:** Begin Search using prompt.![Reset Icon](./img/wcs_summary_07_iconSearch.png)

Query Prompt

The Query Prompt can be changed manually in the query text box and run against a Weaviate Vector DB giving you the opportunity to experiment with your own ideas.
