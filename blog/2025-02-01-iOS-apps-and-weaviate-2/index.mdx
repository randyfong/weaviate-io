# Overview

Understanding the capabilities of Weaviate Cloud (WCD) queries and implementing them practically in your applications is not always obvious. This article aims to help you bridge that gap by providing detailed explanations of common and easily implemented query types, along with a live tool to demonstrate the results.

Included is a downloadable application for Mac users to run live examples directly on their laptop. 

Feel free to copy and paste these queries into your own projects for use as a template for your own queries.

1. [Query App](#query_app). A working MacOS app that runs queries.

1. [Query Examples](#query_examples). Query prompt examples.
