API Settings 

The first order of business is to create the API keys needed to run the application as needed.

API Key Settings Panel

Of the 3 API Keys, the **Weaviate API key is already defined** for you and cannot be changed for this demo app.

An explanation of each key, how it is used, and a link to how to define your own appears below.

- **Weaviate API Key:** Access key to the Weaviate Vector DB that holds the domain data
- **OpenAI API Key:** Access key to OpenAI that Weaviate uses to access OpenAI Large Language Models to query embeddings. Create a key at: <https://openai.com/>
- **Cohere API Key:** Access key to Cohere that Weaviate uses for text embedding, generative AI and reranking. Create a key at: <https://cohere.com>/

Keys can be defined to the application by clicking on the settings icon to bring up the **API Key Settings Panel**.
